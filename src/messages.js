🎈 *Guidance for the Traveler*

This bot serves as your lantern in the RedBalloon ecosystem.
Here you will find supply, rituals, lore, and price windows.

But remember:
Nothing here is prophecy.
Nothing here is financial advice.

Every ascent comes with wind.
Hold your rope with wisdom.

    lore: `
📜 *The Lore of the Red Balloon*

Born from heartbreak and almost-moments,
RedBalloon is the myth of all things that rise too late,
float too briefly,
yet remain forever unforgettable.

99 million dreams were released into the sky.
But only 9.9 million—according to ancient whisper—  
are destined to ascend into the higher air.

We burn not in anger,
but in ceremony.
Not to chase the moon,
but to lighten the burden of ascent.

Float with intention.
Rise with humility.
Let the wind decide the rest.

📊 *The Structure of the Float*

• *Initial Creation:* 99,000,000 RBLN

• *Final Float Supply:* 69,000,000 RBLN

A balloon rises not by force,
but by releasing what it no longer needs.

🔥 *Rituals of Release*

In the tradition of RedBalloon,
we do not burn on emotion.
We burn on time.

• *Ritual I – Day 3:* Release 10,000,000 RBLN  
• *Ritual II – Day 6:* Release 10,000,000 RBLN  
• *Ritual III – Day 9:* Release 10,000,000 RBLN  

When the third ritual is complete,
the pilot retires,
and the balloon drifts free into legend.
